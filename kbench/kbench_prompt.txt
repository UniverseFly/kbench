K is a rewrite-based executable semantic framework. Your will be given a part of a K code file and your task is to write a complete version of the file.

Here is the {part} part of the K code file:

```k
{context}
```

Write the complete K code file and wrap the final code between ```k and ```.

Hint: the complete K code file has {num_lines} lines.
